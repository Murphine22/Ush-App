  # Fix Expenses RLS Policy

  1. Security Changes
    - Drop existing restrictive RLS policies for expenses table
    - Add new policies allowing public access for all CRUD operations
    - Maintain RLS enabled for future security enhancements

  2. Policy Updates
    - Allow public SELECT access to read all expense records
    - Allow public INSERT access to create new expense records
    - Allow public UPDATE access to modify existing expense records
    - Allow public DELETE access to remove expense records

  3. Consistency
    - Matches RLS pattern used by other tables in the system
    - Compatible with current client-side authentication system
    - Resolves "new row violates row-level security policy" errors
